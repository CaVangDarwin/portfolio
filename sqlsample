-- Project: Customer Segmentation Analysis

-- Import necessary libraries
USE bank_database;

-- Task 1: Data Exploration
-- 1.1 Get an overview of the customer table
SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 10;

-- 1.2 Calculate the total number of customers
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM customers;

-- Task 2: Customer Segmentation
-- 2.1 Segment customers based on their age groups
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN age <= 25 THEN '18-25'
        WHEN age <= 35 THEN '26-35'
        WHEN age <= 45 THEN '36-45'
        WHEN age <= 55 THEN '46-55'
        ELSE '55+'
    END AS age_group,
    COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY age_group
ORDER BY customer_count DESC;

-- 2.2 Segment customers based on their account balances
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN balance < 1000 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN balance < 10000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'High'
    END AS balance_group,
    COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY balance_group
ORDER BY customer_count DESC;

-- Task 3: Customer Behavior Analysis
-- 3.1 Calculate the average transaction amount by gender
SELECT
    gender,
    AVG(amount) AS avg_transaction_amount
FROM transactions t
JOIN customers c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY gender;

-- 3.2 Calculate the total transaction amount by month
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date) AS transaction_month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_transaction_amount
FROM transactions
GROUP BY transaction_month
ORDER BY transaction_month;
